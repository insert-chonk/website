<p>You’ve probably seen those YouTube comments that say something like, “Take a shot every time someone says [insert word/phrase that has been repeated numerous times in video].” (Disclaimer: I am not advocating for anyone to actually do this challenge; you would probably get alcohol poisoning and die.)</p>
<p>But did you know you could use R and Python together to count the number of times the word has been said?</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the lyrics of the “Krusty Krab Pizza” song from Spongebob Squarepants. We’ll be counting the number of times the word “pizza” is said. The full lyrics are included in the following string.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import re

string1=&quot;[Squidward] Ow Ow Ow! (x2 over SBSP) [SBSP] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza [Squidward] And my feet are killing me [SBSP] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza free del-i-very The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-as-ty ...It&#39;s for the customer! [Squidward] Who cares about the customer?! [SBSP] (gasps) Squidward! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza absolutivaly [SBSP rap] ba ba ba ba pizza co co cling cling tish pizza tee tee oga ba ta du du du du pizza do do dugga da da pizza du do duga ding (low pitched spongebob) &#39;Krusty Kraahyahayabyahahyab pizza, is the pizza for, (high pitched spongebob) you and meheeheeheeee!&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In Python code chunks, use ‘r’ to access R-defined objects (e.g. r“pizza”). We can use re.findall to grab all instances of the word “pizza”.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python chunk
re.findall(r&quot;pizza&quot;,string1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;, &#39;pizza&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>We can also count the total number by storing the iterations in a tuple and then using len().</p>
<pre class="python"><code>pizzacounts=tuple(re.finditer(r&quot;pizza&quot;,string1))
len(pizzacounts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 18</code></pre>
<p>The word “pizza” is said a total of 18 times in the song. Sure, we could have counted them manually (slowly and individually) like a brute, or copied and pasted the video transcript into Microsoft Word and used Ctrl+F, but where’s the fun in that? I’d rather use code instead!</p>
