R and Python want to play together! Aww :')
Let's get them a reticulate package so they can play.
```{r}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
#Python code chunk
print("hello world")
x="dog"
x

import re

string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"
print(string1)



re.findall(r"\d+",string1)
```

```{r}

py$x
y<-2
```

```{python}
r.y+1 == 3
```
