      <description>You’ve probably seen those YouTube comments that say something like, “Take a shot every time someone says [insert word/phrase that has been repeated numerous times in video].” (Disclaimer: I am not advocating for anyone to actually do this challenge; you would probably get alcohol poisoning and die.)
